  <h1>DATIM ETL Priorities and Communication Plan</h1>
  <h2> General Overview</h2>
  <h3><i>Last updated: 06/24/19</i></h3>
  <p>
    The purpose of this website is to provide information to our NFS and FIA stakeholders on the general
    process of prioritizing states to ETL data to the PROD server; how special requests to load data are handled and processing times;
    and how we determine what will be ETL'd next.
  </p>
  <p>
    We will be sure to keep this website updated with any new ETL updates, so please bookmark it and refer to it as often as you need to. If
    you would like to see any other information here, please reach out to <a href="mailto:winnie.david@usda.gov">winnie.david@usda.gov</a>.

    This website consists of four different pages which are briefly described here:
    <ul>
      <li>
        <b>Home</b> - [You're currently here.] This page provides a general overview of the DATIM ETL Priorities and Communication Plan.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Loaded Data</b> - In table form this page provides information of what we recently started loading to the DATIM datamart. The information includes the states that have
        been loaded, the inventory years that were loaded,
        and the date it was loaded.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Special Requests</b> - This page describes how special requests are handled. Special requests are requests to load specific state(s)
        and year(s) that are sent to the DATIM email or requested via the Contact Us page in DATIM.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>What's Next to be Loaded?</b> - This page goes over the process to determine what data will be ETL'd next and is in the queue.
      </li>
    </ul>
