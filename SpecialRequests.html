<h1> DATIM ETL Priorities and Communication Plan</h1>
<h2>Special Requests</h2>
  <h3><i>Last updated: 06/24/19</i></h3>
  <body>
<p>
  Special requests are mainly received through the <a href="mailto:datim@fs.fed.us"> DATIM email</a> and can also be requested
  via the <a href="https://apps.fs.usda.gov/DATIM/ContactUs/Index">Contact Us</a> page in DATIM.
  </p>
  <p>
    As long as the DATIM DataMart team does not run into any issues with loading the data
    for a particular state, then the state can usually be loaded within 1-2 business days. If we
    encounter issues with the data load, we first investigate and if needed we reach out for assistance with correcting
    the data in FIADB.
    </p>

    <p>
      We keep the requestor informed with any issues we are dealing with and when we think they will be resolved.
