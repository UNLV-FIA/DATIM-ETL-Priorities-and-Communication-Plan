  <h1> DATIM ETL Priorities and Communication Plan</h1>
  <h2>What's Next to be Loaded?</h2>
  <h3><i>Last updated: 06/24/19</i></h3>
  <body>
<p>
  Our to-do list at the moment consists of getting the SRS states loaded as soon
  as possible. The DATIM DataMart team is in communication with Jeff Turner who is working
  with others to get the FIADB data reloaded by the end of June - beginning of July.
  As soon as the data is fixed, we will be making the SRS states our priority to be
  ETL'd into the DATIM DataMart.
  </p>

  <p>
    In the meantime as we wait for the SRS states to be reloaded into FIADB and if there are no outstanding
    special requests, then we refer to the <a href="https://enterprisecontent-usfs.opendata.arcgis.com/datasets/bc09d4e07dbb4d539a8e46dd3639b5fe">Most recent FIA data by State and Collection Year </a> map to determine
    which states need an ETL refresh because new data has been loaded for that state. We
    check this map periodically to ensure we are providing the most up to data in DATIM.
    </p>

    <p>
      The table below details our current plan for loading data. This table includes the state and
        date we plan to load the data.
